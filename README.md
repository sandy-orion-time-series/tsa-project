Time Series Project
Orion Wills and Sandy Graham
for Codeup Data Science Ada Cohort

We analysed some anonymous fitbit data to summarize data, to discern attributes about the owner of the fitbit that generated the data, and to predict missing data. Our final project is in tsa_project_orion_sandy.ipynb and we used proj_acquire.py and proj_prepare.py. Our predictions are in predicted_data.csv.
